# 🔧 Copilot BYOK Streaming Fix - Status Report

## ✅ What's Working
- **Path rewriting**: `/api/chat` → `/v1/chat/completions` ✅
- **Tool schema patching**: Auto-adds missing `parameters` objects ✅ 
- **Basic streaming**: curl tests show proper server-sent events ✅
- **Error handling**: Connection resets handled gracefully ✅
- **Headers**: Proper streaming headers set ✅

## ❌ Current Issue
Copilot immediately disconnects with `ECONNRESET` causing:
```
[POST] Client closed connection for /v1/chat/completions
[POST] Client disconnected from /v1/chat/completions: ECONNRESET
```

Copilot shows: "Sorry, your request failed. Please try again."

## 🔍 Analysis
The proxy works perfectly with curl but fails with Copilot. This suggests:

1. **Timing sensitivity**: Copilot expects immediate response establishment
2. **Header compatibility**: Copilot may need specific header combinations  
3. **Authentication**: BYOK might require specific auth handling
4. **Buffering**: Node.js/Express might be buffering responses

## 🛠️ Attempted Fixes
1. ✅ Improved error handling (removed aggressive connection termination)
2. ✅ Set proper streaming headers (`text/event-stream`, `no-cache`)
3. ✅ Added CORS headers and authorization support
4. ✅ Added header flushing and heartbeat
5. ❌ Still getting immediate disconnects from Copilot

## 💡 Next Steps

### Option 1: VS Code Settings Adjustment
Try these VS Code settings to improve compatibility:

```json
{
  "github.copilot.advanced.debug.overrideEngine": "http://127.0.0.1:11434",
  "github.copilot.advanced.debug.useNodeFetcher": true,
  "github.copilot.advanced.debug.testOverrideProxyUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:11434",
  "github.copilot.advanced.debug.overrideProxyUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:11434"
}
```

### Option 2: Alternative Proxy Implementation
Consider using a more robust HTTP proxy like nginx or a dedicated reverse proxy.

### Option 3: OpenAI API Compatibility
Since the proxy works with curl, it might work with other OpenAI-compatible clients.

## 🧪 Testing Commands

### Test with curl (should work):
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/chat \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"qwen3","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello"}],"stream":true}'
```

### Test with Copilot:
1. Set `"github.copilot.advanced.debug.overrideEngine": "http://127.0.0.1:11434"`
2. Try using Copilot Chat or inline completion
3. Check proxy logs for connection patterns

## 📝 Current Status
The proxy is technically correct and working. The issue appears to be Copilot-specific client behavior that might require either:
- Different VS Code configuration
- Alternative proxy implementation
- Different approach to BYOK integration

The foundation is solid - path rewriting, tool patching, and streaming all work correctly.
