🚀 Copilot BYOK → llama.cpp Integration Proxy 🚀
Version: 1.0.0 (with DeepSeek Thinking Mode support)
A seamless bridge for VS Code Copilot and local llama.cpp (llama-server) with tool support.
🕐 Started at: 2025-08-06T15:17:52.921Z (PID: 853609)
===========================================

Proxy listening on http://127.0.0.1:11434
Upstream target: http://127.0.0.1:11433
Configure VS Code to use: http://127.0.0.1:11434
Instead of: http://127.0.0.1:11433

🧠 Thinking Mode Configuration:
   Mode: vscode
   Debug: disabled

   Available modes:
   - 'vscode': Standard reasoning_content for VSCode Copilot (default)
   - 'events': Custom 'event: thinking' SSE events only
   - 'both': Both standard and custom events
   - 'content': Route thinking to normal content stream (VSCode will display it!)
   - 'off': Disable thinking content entirely

   Configure with: THINKING_MODE=content THINKING_DEBUG=true node proxy-server.js

💭 ,
💭  then

💭  Each

💭 

Check

💭  I

💭 .
💭  Maybe
💭  mention

💭  Or

Wait

💭 W
💭  is
💭  used
💭  by
💭  Bitcoin
💭  but
💭  not

💭 ,
💭  or

💭 .
💭 

Also

💭  maybe
💭  discuss
💭  the
💭  limitations
💭  and
💭  how
💭  they

💭  Like

I

💭  step
💭  by
💭  step
💭 .
💭 

First
💭 ,
💭  Sh
💭 or
💭 's
💭  algorithm
💭 .
💭  I
💭  remember
💭  it
💭 's
💭  used
💭  for
💭  fact
💭 oring
💭  large
💭  numbers
💭  efficiently
💭 ,
💭  which
💭  is
💭  important
💭  for
💭  cryptography
💭 .
💭  But
💭  how
💭  does
💭  it
💭  work
💭 ?
💭  I
💭  think
💭  it
💭  uses
💭  quantum
💭  Fourier
💭  transforms
💭 .
💭  So
💭 ,
💭  the
💭  main
💭  idea
💭  is
💭  that
💭  Sh
💭 or
💭 's
💭  algorithm
💭  can
💭  factor
💭  numbers
💭  exponentially
💭  faster
💭  than
💭  classical
💭  algorithms
💭 .
💭  But
💭  wait
💭 ,
💭  how
💭  does
💭  that
💭  translate
💭  into
💭  steps
💭 ?
💭 

Sh
💭 or
💭 's
💭  algorithm
💭  starts
💭  by
💭  finding
💭  the
💭  period
💭  of
💭  a
💭  function
💭  f
💭 (x
💭 )
💭  =
💭  a
💭 ^
💭 x
💭  mod
💭  N
💭 ,
💭  where
💭  N
💭  is
💭  the
💭  number
💭  we
💭  want
💭  to
💭  factor
💭 .
💭  Once
💭  you
💭  find
💭  the
💭  period
💭 ,
💭  you
💭  can
💭  use
💭  that
💭  to
💭  find
💭  the
💭  factors
💭  of
💭  N
💭 .
💭  But
💭  how
💭  do
💭  you
💭  find
💭  the
💭  period
💭  using
💭  quantum
💭  computing
💭 ?
💭  I
💭  think
💭  it
💭  involves
💭  creating
💭  a
💭  quantum
💭  state
💭  that
💭  represents
💭  multiple
💭  x
💭  values
💭  and
💭  then
💭  using
💭  a
💭  quantum
💭  Fourier
💭  transform
💭  to
💭  find
💭  the
💭  period
💭 .
💭 

Wait
💭 ,
💭  maybe
💭  I
💭  should
💭  outline
💭  the
💭  steps
💭  more
💭  clearly
💭 .
💭  First
💭 ,
💭  choose
💭  a
💭  number
💭  N
💭  to
💭  factor
💭 .
💭  Then
💭  pick
💭  a
💭  random
💭  integer
💭  a
💭  between

💭  If

💭  Then

💭  But
💭  how
💭  does
💭  this
💭  use
💭  quantum
💭  computing
💭 ?
💭 

Quant
💭 um
💭 ly
💭 ,
💭  you
💭  create
💭  a
💭  super
💭 position
💭  of
💭  states
💭  and
💭  apply
💭  the
💭  quantum
💭  Fourier
💭  transform
💭 .
💭  The
💭  quantum
💭  part
💭  is
💭  using
💭  the
💭  quantum
💭  computer
💭  to
💭  find
💭  the
💭  period
💭  efficiently
💭 .
💭  The
💭  key
💭  here
💭  is
💭  that
💭  the
💭  period
💭 -f
💭 inding
💭  problem
💭  can
💭  be
💭  solved
💭  in
💭  polynomial
💭  time
💭  on
💭  a
💭  quantum
💭  computer
💭 ,
💭  which
💭  is
💭  exponentially
💭  faster
💭  than
💭  classical
💭  methods
💭 .
💭 

So
💭  the
💭  steps
💭  for
💭  Sh
💭 or
💭 's
💭  algorithm
💭  would
💭  be
💭 :
💭  create
💭  a
💭  quantum
💭  circuit
💭  that
💭  computes
💭  f
💭 (x
💭 )
💭  =
💭  a
💭 ^
💭 x
💭  mod
💭  N
💭  for
💭  multiple
💭  x
💭  values
💭 ,
💭  then
💭  use
💭  the
💭  quantum
💭  Fourier
💭  transform
💭  to
💭  find
💭  the
💭  period
💭 .
💭  The
💭  main
💭  mathematical
💭  principle
💭  here
💭  is
💭  the
💭  ability
💭  to
💭  perform
💭  a
💭  quantum
💭  Fourier
💭  transform
💭  which
💭  can
💭  find
💭  the
💭  period
💭  in
💭  O
💭 (log
💭  N
💭 )
💭  time
💭 ,
💭  whereas
💭  classical
💭  algorithms
💭  take
💭  O
💭 (e
💭 ^(
💭 √
💭 (
💭 log
💭  N
💭  log
💭  log
💭  N
💭 )))
💭  time
💭 .
💭 

Now
💭 ,
💭  implications
💭  for
💭  classical
💭  computing
💭 :
💭  Sh
💭 or
💭 's
💭  algorithm
💭  breaks
💭  RSA
💭  encryption
💭 ,
💭  which
💭  relies
💭  on
💭  the
💭  difficulty
💭  of
💭  fact
💭 oring
💭  large
💭  numbers
💭 .
💭  This
💭  means
💭  that
💭  if
💭  a
💭  large
💭 -scale
💭  quantum
💭  computer
💭  is
💭  built
💭 ,
💭  current
💭  cryptographic
💭  systems
💭  would
💭  be
💭  vulnerable
💭 .
💭  So
💭  this
💭  has
💭  big
💭  implications
💭  for
💭  cybersecurity
💭  and
💭  data
💭  security
💭 .
💭 

Next

💭  Gro

💭 .
💭  I
💭  remember
💭  it
💭 's
💭  for

💭  instead

💭 )
💭  for

💭  algorithms
💭 .
💭  How
💭  does
💭  that
💭  work
💭 ?
💭 

Gro
💭 ver
💭 's
💭  algorithm
💭  uses
💭  amplitude
💭  ampl
💭 ification
💭 .
💭  The
💭  idea
💭  is
💭  to
💭  create
💭  a
💭  super
💭 position
💭  of
💭  all
💭  possible
💭  states
💭 ,
💭  then
💭  apply
💭  a

💭  of
💭  operations
💭  that
💭  amplify
💭  the
💭  amplitude
💭  of
💭  the
💭  correct
💭  answer
💭 .
💭  The
💭  key
💭  is
💭  the
💭  Gro
💭 ver
💭  iteration
💭 ,
💭  which
💭  involves
💭  the
💭  oracle
💭  that
💭  marks
💭  the
💭  correct
💭  state
💭  and
💭  the
💭  diffusion
💭  operator
💭  that
💭  in
💭 verts
💭  about
💭  the
💭  average
💭 .
💭 

Math
💭 em
💭 atically
💭 ,
💭  the
💭  algorithm
💭  starts
💭  with
💭  a
💭  uniform
💭  super
💭 position
💭  over
💭  all
💭  possible
💭  inputs
💭 .
💭  Then
💭 ,
💭  it
💭  applies
💭  the
💭  oracle
💭  which
💭  flips
💭  the
💭  sign
💭  of
💭  the
💭  target
💭  state
💭 .
💭  Then
💭  the
💭  diffusion
💭  operator
💭  reflects
💭  around
💭  the
💭  average
💭  amplitude
💭 .
💭  This
💭  is
💭  repeated
💭  for
💭  O
💭 (

💭 Okay

💭 

Starting
💭  with

💭  Computing
💭  Fund

💭  The

💭  the
💭  mathematical
💭  foundations
💭  of
💭  quantum
💭  mechanics
💭  applied
💭  to

💭 .
💭  So
💭 ,
💭  I
💭  should
💭  begin
💭  with
💭  the

💭  of

💭  mechanics
💭 —
💭 super
💭 position
💭 ,
💭  ent
💭 ang
💭 lement
💭 ,
💭  and
💭  interference
💭 .
💭  Then
💭  compare
💭  classical
💭  bits
💭  with
💭  q
💭 ubits
💭 ,
💭  explain
💭  the
💭  Blo
💭 ch
💭  sphere
💭 ,
💭  and
💭  how

💭  gates
💭  manipulate
💭  states
💭 .
💭  I
💭  need
💭  to
💭  make
💭  sure
💭  I
💭  cover
💭  the

💭  behind
💭  these
💭  concepts
💭 ,
💭  maybe
💭  using
💭  equations
💭  for
💭  super

💭  and
💭  the

💭 .
💭  Also
💭 ,
💭  the
💭  Blo
💭 ch

💭  representation
💭  is
💭  key
💭  here
💭 ,
💭  so
💭  I

💭  I

💭  Start

💭  (
💭 Q

💭 ),
💭  then
💭  classical

💭 .
💭  I
💭  should
💭  explain

💭 ,
💭  how
💭  it
💭 's
💭  used
💭  to
💭  find

💭  societal
💭  implications
💭 .
💭  Let
💭  me
💭  start
💭  by
💭  breaking
💭  down
💭  each
💭  of
💭  these
💭  areas
💭  and
💭  think
💭  through
💭  them
💭  systematically
💭 .
💭 

First
💭 ,
💭  machine
💭  learning
💭  advances
💭 .
💭  I
💭  know
💭  that
💭  ML
💭  has
💭  been
💭  growing
💭  rapidly
💭 ,
💭  especially
💭  with
💭  deep
💭  learning
💭 .
💭  Recent
💭  trends
💭  include
💭  things
💭  like
💭  transformers
💭 ,
💭  which
💭  are
💭  used
💭  in
💭  N
💭 LP
💭  tasks
💭 .
💭  Maybe
💭  I
💭  should
💭  talk
💭  about
💭  how
💭  models
💭  are
💭  getting
💭  bigger
💭 ,
💭  like
💭  the
💭  increase
💭  in
💭  parameters
💭  and
💭  the
💭  use
💭  of
💭  more
💭  data
💭 .
💭  Also
💭 ,
💭  there
💭 's
💭  the
💭  shift
💭  from
💭  supervised
💭  to
💭  uns
💭 up
💭 ervised
💭  or
💭  semi
💭 -sup
💭 ervised
💭  learning
💭 .
💭  Maybe
💭  mention
💭  self
💭 -sup
💭 ervised
💭  learning
💭  techniques
💭 ,
💭  like
💭  those
💭  used
💭  in
💭  B
💭 ERT
💭  or
💭  other
💭  pre
💭 -training
💭  models
💭 .
💭  Also
💭 ,
💭  reinforcement
💭  learning
💭  has
💭  been
💭  a
💭  big
💭  area
💭 ,
💭  especially
💭  in
💭  games
💭  and
💭  robotics
💭 .
💭  Then
💭  there
💭 's
💭  the
💭  concept
💭  of
💭  meta
💭 -learning
💭 ,
💭  where
💭  models
💭  can
💭  adapt
💭  to
💭  new
💭  tasks
💭  quickly
💭 .
💭  Oh
💭 ,
💭  and
💭  maybe
💭  the
💭  integration
💭  of
💭  ML
💭  with
💭  other
💭  fields
💭 ,
💭  like
💭  healthcare
💭  or
💭  finance
💭 .
💭 

Next
💭 ,
💭  neural
💭  architecture
💭  innovations
💭 .
💭  This
💭  could
💭  involve
💭  changes
💭  in
💭  how
💭  neural
💭  networks
💭  are
💭  structured
💭 .
💭  Maybe
💭  talk
💭  about
💭  architectures
💭  that
💭  are
💭  more
💭  efficient
💭 ,
💭  like
💭  sp
💭 iking
💭  neural
💭  networks
💭  or
💭  neu
💭 rom
💭 orphic
💭  computing
💭 .
💭  Also
💭 ,
💭  hybrid
💭  models
💭  that
💭  combine
💭  different
💭  types
💭  of
💭  networks
💭 ,
💭  like
💭  CNN
💭 s
💭  and
💭  R
💭 NN
💭 s
💭 .
💭  There
💭 's
💭  also
💭  the
💭  idea
💭  of
💭  neural
💭  architecture
💭  search
💭  (
💭 NAS
💭 ),
💭  where
💭  the
💭  model
💭  itself
💭  is
💭  optimized
💭  for
💭  performance
💭 .
💭  Maybe
💭  mention
💭  how
💭  attention
💭  mechanisms
💭  have
💭  evolved
💭  beyond
💭  transformers
💭 ,
💭  like
💭  in
💭  vision
💭  transformers
💭  or
💭  other
💭  variants
💭 .
💭  Also
💭 ,
💭  maybe
💭  the
💭  move
💭  towards
💭  more
💭  modular
💭  or
💭  customizable
💭  architectures
💭  that
💭  can
💭  be
💭  adapted
💭  for
💭  different
💭  tasks
💭 .

💭  a

💭  that
💭  can

💭  any

💭  Right
💭  now
💭 ,
💭  we
💭  have
💭  narrow

💭  which
💭  is
💭  specialized

💭  The
💭  timeline
💭  for

💭  Some

💭 ,
💭  others
💭  think
